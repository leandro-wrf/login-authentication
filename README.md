<h4>What I learned from this project</h4>
<p align="justify">
Using the functions of jwt.sign and jwt.verify, creating table models to use sequelize, understanding the idea of migrations in sequelize, I added validations to this project, both on mobile and backend.
Something I understood during the process, the use of react-native, for this project I decided to remove it and test it in other applications, because as I found myself in an application where the focus was different, I ended up mixing things up and added something unnecessary, even though I knew that the expo would serve the necessary use of my project.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Something very important for me, and that I will take as knowledge.
The organization of the files in the project helps a lot to not get lost, not to pollute a file with codes, thus making your reading less complex and that ends up impelling you to finish what you started.
